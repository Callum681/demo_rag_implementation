# demo_rag_implementation

During my work on AI-agent systems, I built a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline similar to the one in this repo as a proof-of-concept knowledge assistant to help agents access technical documentation dynamically instead of relying purely on their training data. This project demos the basic idea behind this RAG application.
