# demo_rag_implementation

During my work on AI-agent systems, I built a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline similar to the one in this repo as a proof-of-concept knowledge assistant to help agents access technical documentation dynamically instead of relying purely on their training data. rag_demo.py demos the basic idea behind this RAG application. 

fine_tune_tinyllm.py is an additional demo file which fine-tunes a small language model (DistilGPT2) on a custom Q&A dataset. This is another simplified and cleansed example of the model tuning carried out in the same internship.
